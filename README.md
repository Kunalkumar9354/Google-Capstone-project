Title: Bellabeat Marketing Analysis Case Study

## Introduction

Welcome to the Bellabeat marketing analysis case study! In this project, I will be performing the tasks of a junior data analyst at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The goal is to analyze smart device usage data and gain insights into how consumers are using non-Bellabeat smart devices. Based on the analysis, I will provide high-level recommendations to inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Business Task

The business task is to analyze smart device usage data and identify trends that could apply to Bellabeat customers. This analysis will help us understand how consumers are utilizing their smart devices and how these insights can influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Data Sources

The primary data source for this analysis is the "FitBit Fitness Tracker Data" dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring from thirty Fitbit users. This data will allow us to explore users' daily habits and usage patterns of smart devices.

## Data Preparation

I downloaded and stored the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data in an appropriate folder. The data is organized in a long format, with detailed information on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. I also verified the data's credibility and ensured its integrity before proceeding with the analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Manipulation

During the data cleaning process, I checked for errors, transformed the data to work effectively, and documented the entire cleaning process. This step ensures that the data is clean and ready for analysis.

## Data Analysis

I aggregated and organized the data to perform analysis effectively. By exploring the data, I identified interesting trends and relationships among smart device users. These insights will help answer the key business questions and guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Data Visualization and Key Findings

Using various data visualization techniques, I created visualizations to present the key findings from the analysis. The visualizations effectively communicate the insights discovered in the data.

## High-Level Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I have developed high-level recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy. These recommendations are driven by the trends and insights observed in smart device usage data and can help Bellabeat unlock new growth opportunities.

## Conclusion

The Bellabeat marketing analysis case study provides valuable insights into smart device usage and how it can influence marketing strategy. The analysis highlights potential areas for growth and enables Bellabeat to make data-driven decisions to cater to their customers' needs effectively. By implementing the high-level recommendations, Bellabeat can further establish itself as a leading high-tech wellness company for women.
